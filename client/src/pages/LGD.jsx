                <p className="paragraphLGD">A Livestock Guardian Dog, also known as a LGD, is a dog that guards livestock from predators. They are a working dog that lives with the animals they protect. Fro the time they are eight weeks old till they pass, the LGD's live with the animals they protect. They do not attack the animals they protect, and the animals view them as part of the herd.</p>
                <p className="paragraphLGD">LGD's take their jobs very seriously. They dislike leaving the animals they protect, this is very stressful for them. This stress means that our LGD's are treated by the same vet as the goats they protect. They also receive special goodies in their food so that they can work at maximum capacity.
                </p> 
                <p className="paragraphLGD">Some of the predators they guard animals from include wild dogs, coyotes, bears, mountain lions, wolves, wolverines, opossums and raccoons. The smaller animals may not kill a goat outright but can carry diseases. CU@LilRedBarn employees four Livestock Guardian Dogs.</p>
